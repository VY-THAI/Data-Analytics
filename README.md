Throughout this project, I acquired significant expertise in advanced analytical methods (particularly in Python), which enabled us to perform a thorough examination of the dataset and extract valuable insights. Additionally, the project enhanced my transferable skills, including Complex Problem-Solving, Communication,
and Collaboration. This experience has been instrumental in developing my ability to handle data-driven projects and collaborate in a professional setting.
